Push_swap: I used the radix sort algorithm and I got a score of 84/100.

Push_swap_bonus: I used a greedy algorithm and I implemented the lis and I did the bonus part so I got a score of 125/100

Special thanks to [lde-mich](https://github.com/lde-mich) who wrote most of the code and [Ukudot](https://github.com/Ukudot) who helped me a lot to understand and implement the lis.
